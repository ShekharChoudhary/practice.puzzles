/**
 * Longest subarray not having more then K distinct elements
 * 
 * Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            k = 6 
Output : 1 2 3 4 5 
Explanation: The whole array has only 5 
distinct elements which is less then k, 
so we print the array itself.

Input: arr[] = {6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5}
           k = 3
Output: 1 2 3 2 1, 
The output is the longest subarray with 3
distinct elements.
